# SESSION INFORMATION

## Title

Security Infrastrucure as Code for Entra ID and Graph API

## Description

This highly technical and demo-heavy session will look into the recentl developments and previews of the Graph API resource support from Bicep and Terraform, and compare usage scenarios to those already available via Terraform and Azure AD/Entra ID provider. We will look into how to combine traditional Azure resource deployments together with Entra ID and Graph API resources, moving even more deployment scenarios to declarative infrastructure-as-code, both for local deployment and for DevOps pipelines or actions.
